# Text-Generation-using-LSTM

This project implements a text generation model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on a text corpus and generates text character by character based on the learned patterns from the training data.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a character-level text generation model using LSTM neural networks. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequence data, making them suitable for tasks like text generation, where maintaining the context of prior words or characters is crucial.

 # Features
 - Character-based generation: The model generates text one character at a time.
 - Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and tokenized into characters.
 - LSTM-based model: The model architecture consists of stacked LSTM layers for learning patterns from sequences.
 - Custom Loss Function: A categorical cross-entropy loss function is used to optimize the model
 - Text Sampling: Different sampling techniques are used to generate text with varying levels of creativity and coherence.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training can be any large text corpus. In this project, a user-defined text file is used, which is tokenized at character level.

# Model Architecture
The LSTM model is designed to generate text sequences as follows:

- Input layer: Encodes each character into a one-hot vector representation.
- Stacked LSTM layers: Multiple LSTM layers are used to capture long-term dependencies and sequential patterns in the text.
- Dense layer: The final layer outputs a softmax probability distribution over all possible characters.

# Training
The model is trained using the following key configurations:

- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Batch Size: 64
- Epochs: 20 (this can be adjusted based on the dataset size and computational resources)
During training, the model learns to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previous characters.

# Text Generation

After the model is trained, it can generate text by starting with an initial character or sequence and predicting the next characters one by one. The model learns patterns from the training data and uses these to continue the sequence, creating new text that follows the learned structure. You can input any starting sequence, and the model will build on it to generate text automatically

# Results

Once trained, the model is capable of generating coherent text sequences based on the input data. The generated text reflects patterns learned from the training dataset. The model's ability to generate coherent text improves as training progresses, producing more meaningful sequences over time.
